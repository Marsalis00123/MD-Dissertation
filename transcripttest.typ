ct and mr of spine infections for about the
next half hour
our learning objectives are pretty
straightforward we're going to teach you
how the pathophysiology and particularly
the vascular anatomy
help to determine the imaging appearance
of spine infections
we'll learn to critically assess which
imaging options
offer the greatest sensitivity both for
initial diagnosis
as well as post-treatment assessment
and this is a real bugaboo for me
probably for you as well
to be able to differentiate spine
infection from common mimics
most notably degenerative disease
now my colleagues in infectious disease
are able to differentiate extremely
easily
they just order a biopsy in everybody
so it's really my self-interest
that has led me to try to refine this
diagnosis
and try to really differentiate spine
infection from
the more common degenerative disease
now as you'll see when i discuss the
vascular anatomy
primarily what we're speaking about is a
disk space infection
and that's an inflammatory process
involving the disc and adjacent
vertebrae
with extension typically to the epidural
space
and paravertebral soft tissues and
people use a lot of different names and
i would advise you not to use the term
disguise if you think it's infection
say it's infection if you think it's in
the disk
tell them it's in the disc if you think
it's in the vertebral body
tell them it's in the vertebral body but
if you think it's infection
say infection
the major pathogen i'm sorry the major
pathway
is hematogenous spread to the spine
from another infection like a urinary
tract infection or a pneumonia
staph aureus is the major pathogen
accounting for well over 50 percent of
cases
but pseudomonas is a major player
particularly in the iv drug abuser
population
and risk factors in addition to
iv drug abuse include age over 50
infection in another part of the body
and diabetes
let's have a look at the vascular
anatomy so
as i animated before the typical spread
is arterial to the spine the distal
vessels
with slower flow are at the end plate
and or the intervertebral disc
and so the typical pattern of
involvement that we
see on imaging is disk space involvement
and involvement of the adjacent end
plates
now kids and adults are a little bit
different and i'm going to show you this
differentiation
in the child vascular channels cross the
growth plate
so the disc is relatively vascular and
the primary infection from this
hematogenous spread
is within the disc but then it spreads
very quickly
to the adjacent vertebral end plates
in the adult the disc is relatively
hypovascular
and so the initial infection is
in the vertebral end plate or end plates
with secondary spread usually within a
few days
to the intervertebral disc
once the infection becomes established
within the disc
space there is venus spread to
the epidural space sometimes giving you
an epidural phlegmon
sometimes giving you an abscess and i'll
show you how to differentiate those
and also to the pair of vertebral soft
tissues
unfortunately the clinical picture of a
disk space
infection is pretty non-specific it's
progressive spine
pain constant no relief with rest
there's a neurologic deficit and only a
small minority
i think that looking at the sed rate or
the c-reactive protein
is useful because at least
according to my spine surgeons if your
sed rate
is not elevated you really don't have a
significant spine
infection the problem is if you have
infection somewhere else in the body
the sedrate is going to be elevated
whether you have a spine infection or
not
blood cultures are pretty variable i
think a lot of these blood cultures are
taken
after uh one or more of the patient's
infections are
at least partially treated and so these
symptoms are very non-specific
well is plane film any good i mean a lot
of us will screen
for back pain with a plane film
and in this case if you really zero in
you'll see that there are poorly defined
end plates
and remember that vascular anatomy that
i taught you
that's the first place where you're
going to look you can see a nicely
defined end plate here you can see the
sclerosis you can see the sharp margins
you come down here and you've lost that
and you'll be able to see that on plane
film
you'll be able to see that on ct and i'm
going to show you how you can see that
on
mr as well but even those early findings
at least on plane film
will lag two to three weeks after the
clinical symptoms
as the osteomyelitis progresses you can
see that there's more bone destruction
and later findings include bone
sclerosis
and progressive loss of stature this is
obviously late in the infectious process
chronic osteomyelitis will often heal
with ankylosis and kyphosis as i've
shown you on this plane film exam
let's move then to ct well we know that
we should have involvement of opposing
end plates
and an abnormal disk space and i almost
don't have to point
out the findings here on this sagittal
view
notice the well-defined end plates here
there are virtually no end plates here
and certainly the intervertebral disk
space is
involved you can see the paraspinus
involvement
even on this non-contrast ct
obviously the epidural component is a
little bit more challenging
and contrast can really really help you
if you're going to do a ct evaluation
chronically here is that ankylosis and
kyphosis that i showed you on plane film
but one of the things that i really like
are the 3d reconstructions
because you can see the calcification
and ossification that has occurred in
the soft
tissues as a result of that venous
spread
resulting in the ankylosis that we see
okay the real workhorse of course is mr
so i'm really going to focus on mr
findings
in spine infection let's just start with
a t1
where are we going to look we're going
to look at the disc we're going to look
at the vertebral end plates
and you can see here that we've got
some low density and at least a
questionably abnormal disc
let me blow that up for you so you can
see a little bit better
well-defined end plate well-defined end
plate
you come down here where's my black line
where is my end plate
where's my end plate okay so
at least on a t1 one of the areas where
i go
is to look at those end plates now in
this case you can probably see
that we've got an epidural component and
we've got a paraspinous component
as well we can see those components a
little bit better
on the t2 we're also seeing that there's
t2 prolongation or t2 bright signal
involving these vertebral bodies and
kind of plus minus within the disk
disks are a little bit difficult because
sometimes these disks are degenerated
and when they're degenerated you just
don't have very many water protons to
give you much of a signal
you can certainly see the paraspinous
component
and a little bit of epidural component
perhaps
a little bit better seen here off axis
now as i told you my major problem is
differentiating spine infection from
modic type 1 changes
so i decided to review the modic type 1
changes
and you know for historical
interest i went back to mike modic's
original article from the 1988 radiology
and you know if you look at the quality
of these images thank god we've come a
long way
but what dr modic pointed out is
in these modic type 1 degenerative
changes
the end plates are t1 dark
and you can see that here but then they
brighten up
on t2 the disk space is dark on t1
dark on t2 so i've put together
a little chart here and we're going to
expand this chart
as we add various imaging sequences
and you can see that it's pretty
difficult to differentiate
infection from modic type 1 changes just
using a standard t1 and t2
really about the only place that you can
focus
is to look for increased t2 signal
intensity
of the disk and even that is not
always present but that's where you want
to focus
when you're looking at least at a
non-contrast
mr okay so let's add contrast
we'll go back to that cervical spine
case that we could see
and you can see that the disc and
vertebral bodies
show contrast enhancement and the
contrast enhancement really can help you
with the epidural and paraspinous
components of the infection
let's look at a lumbar case we'll start
out with a t1
a t2 and a stir one of the reasons i
show this case is if you're really
trying to go
quickly i would rather look at a stir
than at this t2 everybody buy in on that
i think you can see the t2 prolongation
a little bit better
because of the inherent fat saturation
in the stir imaging so if you're trying
to go quickly
or your ed is asking for a lot of total
spines
what you might want to do is do t1 and
stir
and maybe a few other sequences like a
contrast enhanced
let's look at the contrast enhanced here
is our t1 you can see the low signal
and then that kind of fills in on the
post contrast notice though that the
disk space looks dark here
and boy to my eye it still looks dark
here
so let's enter this data into our chart
and see if contrast enhanced helps us
well it helps us some of the time
if you see the disc enhanced it pushes
you toward
infection but the problem is that it's
not always
present so that is not as much help
as we would hope this is a pretty easy
diagnosis i think everybody would be
able to diagnose
the epidural component the abnormal disc
space the abnormal vertebral bodies in
the paraspinus component
we can add a t1 with fat saturation
and this really helps me to appreciate
the circumferential nature of the
epidural phlegmon
in this case i remember i told you that
i was going to teach you how to
differentiate
phlegmon from abscess phlegmon will show
you solid enhancement
abscess will show you only peripheral
enhancement
let's look at an example this is
obviously a different case we're looking
up here
in the cervical spine and you can see
that there
is some abnormal brightness post
contrast within the c2 vertebral body
you see a small anterior epidural
collection
with low density this is the abscess
and this is surrounding enhancement so
this is an example
of an epidural abscess
now in this case we also went ahead and
got diffusion-weighted imaging
one of the things that we noticed is
that our trainees at the university of
arizona
were having a lot of trouble with these
spine infections
and they basically are our first line at
night
and when it's three in the morning i
want that first
line to be intact making good diagnoses
and being pretty confident about their
diagnosis
so we started to do diffusion weighted
imaging
and these diffusion weighted images are
not the prettiest things on the block
but notice how nicely you can see the
restricted diffusion
and if you really squint you can even
make it out on the adc
that shows you the epidural abscess
in this patient
now according to the literature and i
say according to the literature because
in my hands this was a little bit
difficult
diffusion diffusion-weighted imaging can
reliably
know about that differentiate motor type
1
end plate changes with no restricted
diffusion
from the abnormal end plates in a disk
space infection
well this sounds pretty good but
unfortunately people were turning up
some restricted diffusion even in the
modic type
1 changes and so
i've added this to the chart but i've
sort of given you a little sideways
arrow here that yeah you should have
restricted
diffusion within the end plates
sometimes that occurs
within the disk but not always so can we
refine this a little bit more and a few
years
after one of my former fellows
actually published this paper and he
stated that
a third of the patients with motor type
1 changes in t2 prolongation within the
disc
are really degenerative disease rather
than infection
and that's the conundrum we've been
dealing with so he applied diffusion
imaging and describe the claw sign and
it's important to really wrap your head
around this claw sign because it may not
be that
intuitive it's defined as
well-marginated
linear regions of high signal within the
adjacent vertebral bodies
not necessarily right at the end plate
and a
positive clause sign is degenerative
disease
not infection let's look at some
pictures
this is from dr patel's article you can
see the
you know maybe it's modic maybe it's
infection type
changes and here is the claw side
notice that the end plates aren't so
much involved
but this band or
linear area of restricted diffusion
within the adjacent vertebral body
marrow this is a positive clause sign
this implies degenerative disease
okay and then he went through and he had
different classification systems this is
about what we would expect
in a disk space infection abnormal disc
abnormal vertebral bodies abnormal end
plates
this is the claw sign
no restricted diffusion within the disc
and then these
linear areas of marrow involvement
that define the claw and unfortunately
a lot of cases fall in an indeterminate
range
and what they did is they put together
an algorithm and this is really the
algorithm that i use
so patients symptomatic symptoms
are non-specific so we're not quite sure
what to do with those
but it could be a modic pattern what do
we do
we look at the disk is the disk bright
if it's not bright infection is unlikely
if the disk is bright we haven't solved
our problem yet
we can throw diffusion weighted imaging
into the mix
we can look for the claw sign positive
claw remember
is infection unlikely most likely
degenerative disease
if there's an absent claw then you're
kind of stuck
saying yep this could be disguised and
the patient usually goes to biopsy
okay here is a bit of a problem case
have a look at the c67 level the disc is
t
too bright it enhances but the end
plates are
dark and not enhancing what are we going
to do well of course
we are going to try to do diffusion
this is one of my cases of
a claw sign we were able to avoid biopsy
in this case this is degenerative
disease
another sign that might help you out is
the psoas sign
and the problem of course is that lumbar
disguise osteomyelitis has
characteristics that overlap
with non-infectious causes so look for
psoas hyperintensity
pretty easy to pick this out so is
hyperintensity
so is hyperintensity no hyperintensity
no hyper intensity this is infection
this is degenerative disease but a
useful sign
even on a non-contrast study
let's now look at the time course of
spine infection and i like to follow
this on a contrast-enhanced t-wat
here we've got multiple components
abnormal disc
abnormal vertebral bodies abnormal
epidural
abnormal spinous we did a biopsy
following the biopsy antibiotic therapy
for two weeks
and look what's happened there's now no
abnormal epidural enhancement perispinus
has
decreased but there is persistence of
enhancement here within the vertebral
bodies
and within the intervertebral space so
if you're getting a follow-up where is
your eye going to go
to be efficient what you should be doing
is starting your interrogation
by looking at the epidural space and
looking at the paraspinus soft tissues
that's going to save you some time
that's going to increase your accuracy
let's look at another case here we've
got a multifocal
epidural abscess
10 weeks this time of antibiotic therapy
obviously that was a pretty nasty
infection and look what's happened
the epidural component is much reduced
perhaps cleared away so your eye should
go to that
epidural space even when you have
abscess
if you have prolonged antibiotic therapy
you can clear that
infection so if possible
follow the contrast enhance t1 use fat
saturation
earliest changes epidural and paraspinus
last to show change are the vertebral
bodies
and if you think about it these changes
reflect
the vascularity of the tissues involved
so it all makes sense
now i talked about hematogenous spread
but clearly you can have spread from an
adjacent organ
abnormal chest x-ray you can see on the
ct you've got a lung abscess
and it's extending here to the spine
classic findings of a disk space
infection
contrast helps you can see the epidural
findings
and you know more of the same
facet injections you know a lot of times
we don't pay as much attention
as we should to the facets in this case
it was hard to ignore and then we looked
at the axials
and you can see that there's a lot of
infection going on here
centered on this facet joint and
of note there's a lot of epidural
disease as well
so in somebody where you're looking for
spine infection
i'm looking at the disc spaces first i'm
looking at the vertebral end plates
but before i put this case away i look
at the facet joints as well let's look
at a case of tb
now tb is a real fooler remember i told
you
that in hematogenous spread to the spine
we go to the disk we go to the end plate
and then we spread because there are
proteolytic
enzymes and the proteolytic enzymes
quickly colonize the disk in the adult
and the end plate in the child well what
if you're dealing with an infection that
doesn't
have proteolytic enzymes like tb
it's going to stay in the bone it's not
going to go to the disc and it's not
going to cross the disk space
to involve adjacent vertebral body so
you get a picture like this and
i'll tell you the first thing i think
about when i see something like this
is probably not tb i'm thinking about
a malignancy and i'm thinking about a
malignancy right
you've got marrow replacement end plates
look pretty good
uh intervertebral discs not bad hey we
all know that malignancy can spread
to the paraspinus regions and a lot of
these cases go to biopsy
so many of these cases go to biopsy that
i do the spine biopsies at my place
and so when something that looks like
this comes in
and it says you know evaluate for
neoplasm
i put on a tb mask and i ask my team to
put on a tb mask
as well because occasionally something
that's advertised
as a neoplasm comes back is tb
okay you can look at the t2 i don't know
still looks like uh neoplasm mean look
at how nicely defined those end plates
are
and even contrast doesn't help you all
that much
okay i'm from arizona so i got to show
you a case of coxy
and coxy is a great mimic um
if you're not living in arizona or
california you're probably not going to
see very much of it
which is actually going to make your
life easier
abnormality here within the vertebral
body you know god only knows what
that is it turned out to be coxy
here it looks like we've got something
in the spinal cord
god only knows what that is it turned
out to be coxy
this one's a little easier you can see
there's massive lung involvement
it has extended to involve the spine
it's involving rib here
i think most of us would put cocci
pretty high in our differential
but it can look like just about anything
it can be pretty messy speaking of a
messy case
i'm going to show you one of the really
nasty ones that i've seen here
a lot of times we'll get a ct within the
first few days following surgery
just to make sure the hardware is in
good position and
you know graft material hasn't migrated
and all that
i mean one question i would ask is okay
man you operated on this level and
everything looks good
was there some reason you didn't want to
operate here
maybe they'd done a flexion extension
and this guy was fused here that
so there wasn't too much they could do
in any case we gave him a clean bill of
health
great but
after 17 months the patient returns
obviously not doing well disk space
involvement end plate involvement what
are we dealing with here
i was certainly very concerned about
infection
sorry so
what they tried to do was a laminectomy
and
a kyphoplasty and that didn't really
turn
out to super well you can see the cement
here
i guess they were able to get some
stabilization
but it didn't really help the infection
all that much you can see here that
there
is some stenosis worsening spinal
stenosis the infection is just going
crazy
and they ended up with a major
reconstruction here
and notice that they had to dig out all
that cement
so sometimes these turn out to be pretty
gnarly cases
well what have we learned we reviewed
the plain film ct and mr
appearance of the common spinal
infections and we realized that those
don't always allow us to differentiate
from modic type changes particularly
modic type
1 degenerative changes so we added the
clause sign
which it means you need to do diffusion
and we added the psoas sign
which means that i usually do it on the
axials
you need to look carefully at the t2s we
talked about how the vascular anatomy
determines the initial side of infection
a little different in kids and adults
and then the spread of infection
i illustrated the time course of spinal
infection
you know particularly where do you look
to see the very earliest changes and
you're going to look in the epidural
space and you're going to look at the
paraspinous soft tissues
and then we analyze the components of
the spinal infection
talk about where those early changes
might be seen
thank you so much for your kind
attention
