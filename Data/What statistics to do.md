The dataset contains relevant variables for analyzing the impact of imaging on spondylodiscitis diagnosis and treatment, including:

- **Demographic data**: Age, gender
- **Clinical presentation**: Symptoms, comorbidities, and complications
- **Imaging modalities**: MRI, CT, etc., along with the affected spinal segments and imaging findings
- **Treatment and outcomes**: Surgical or conservative treatment, post-treatment evolution, complications, and markers like CRP, VSH, and WBC.

Given this data, here are my recommendations for statistical analysis methods:

### 1. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - **Purpose**: To describe the patient demographics, imaging modalities used, and clinical characteristics.
   - **Variables**:
     - **Age, gender**: Summary statistics (mean, median, range).
     - **Imaging modality (rm, ct, etc.)**: Frequency of usage.
   - **Graphs**: Bar charts and pie charts to show the distribution of imaging modalities, gender, and outcomes (e.g., surgical vs conservative treatment).

### 2. **Diagnostic Accuracy Analysis**
   - **Purpose**: Evaluate how different imaging findings (e.g., erosion, stenosis) relate to diagnosis or treatment outcomes.
   - **Variables**:
     - **Imaging findings**: Compare the presence of key findings (erosions, abscesses, etc.) across different modalities.
     - **Outcome (favorabil/nefavorabil)**: Diagnostic accuracy indicators for imaging in predicting treatment success.
   - **Analysis**: 
     - **Chi-Square Test**: To compare categorical variables (e.g., contrast use vs outcome).
     - **Sensitivity/Specificity**: If you have a gold standard for diagnosis (e.g., microbiological confirmation).
   - **Graphs**: ROC curve to assess diagnostic performance of imaging modalities.

### 3. **Outcome Analysis**
   - **Purpose**: Assess how imaging influences treatment decisions and outcomes (favorable vs unfavorable).
   - **Variables**:
     - **Imaging characteristics (contrast, findings)**: Correlate with outcomes like recovery, recurrence, or mortality (exitus).
     - **CRP, VSH, WBC**: Markers of inflammation preand post-treatment.
   - **Analysis**: 
     - **Logistic Regression**: To assess how different imaging findings predict outcomes (e.g., recidivÄƒ or exitus).
     - **Paired t-test/Wilcoxon**: If you have preand post-treatment data on CRP, VSH, WBC.
   - **Graphs**: Scatter plots and line graphs to show trends in these variables over time.

### 4. **Multivariate Analysis**
   - **Purpose**: Account for confounding factors (e.g., age, comorbidities) when analyzing the effect of imaging on outcomes.
   - **Variables**:
     - **Age, comorbidities, imaging modality**: Use these as predictors for treatment outcomes.
   - **Analysis**: 
     - **Multivariate Logistic Regression**: To evaluate how multiple factors influence patient recovery or complications.
   - **Graphs**: Forest plot for odds ratios.

This approach will provide a comprehensive analysis of your data, linking imaging findings to patient outcomes and diagnostic accuracy. Let me know if you'd like assistance with specific analysis or graph creation.
