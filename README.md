# The Role of Medical Imaging in the Management and Diagnosis of Spondylodiscitis  

_A Medical Doctor Degree Dissertation Repository_

## About the Project  

This repository showcases the research and analysis conducted for my Medical Doctor Degree dissertation. It focuses on the relationship between the imaging department and clinicians in the diagnosis and management of **spondylodiscitis**. The project combines anonymized real-life data from a high-profile teaching hospital with in-depth statistical analysis to provide meaningful insights.  

### Purpose  

This repository serves as a display for:  

- The anonymized dataset.  
- The statistical analysis code (Python üêç).  
- Figures and resources used in the dissertation.  

It is intended for **professors**, **doctors**, and **students** interested in this field.


## Repository Structure  

- **Main Folder**  
  - Contains the dissertation written in Typst, split into chapter-specific files.  
  - Includes a legacy `Tex/` folder with old LaTeX files, before the migration to Typst.  (for archival purposes)
- **Data/**  
  - Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for statistical analysis.  
- **Files/**  
  - Images used in the dissertation.  

## Features  

- **Real-World Analysis**: Statistical evaluation of anonymized data from a teaching hospital.  
- **Interactive Code**: Analysis conducted using Python üêç and Jupyter Notebooks for reproducibility.
