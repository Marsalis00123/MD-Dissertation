The protective effect of bradycardia in patients with reduced ejection fraction using beta-blockers or ivabradine does not improve symptoms in HFpEF. This review aims to assess current data regarding the impact of anti-bradycardia pacing in patients with HFpEF. A search was conducted on PubMed, ScienceDirect, Springer, and Wiley Online Library, selecting studies from 2013 to 2023. Relevant and eligible prospective studies and randomized controlled trials were included. Functional status, quality of life, and echocardiographic parameters were assessed. Six studies conformed to the selection criteria. Four were prospective studies with a total of 90 patients analyzed. Two were randomized controlled trials with a total of 129 patients assessed. The 6-min walk test (6MWT) and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) score improved in all prospective studies. My-PACE trial showed improvements in MLHFQ score (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), significant relative lowering in NT-proBNP levels (p\,=\,0.02), and an increased mean daily activity in the personalized accelerated pacing group compared to usual care. RAPID-HF trial proved that pacemaker implantation to enhance exercise heart rate (HR) did not improve exercise capacity and was associated with increased adverse events. HFpEF requires a more individualized approach and quality of life management. This review demonstrates that higher resting HR by atrial pacing may improve symptoms and even outcomes in HFpEF, while a higher adaptive rate during exertion has not been proven beneficial.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the area of knowledge that develops computerised models to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These algorithms are programmed to learn and identify patterns from "training data," that can be subsequently applied to new datasets, without being explicitly programmed to do so. AI is revolutionising the field of medical imaging and in particular of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) by providing deep learning solutions for image acquisition, reconstruction and analysis, ultimately supporting the clinical decision making. Numerous methods have been developed over recent years to enhance and expedite CMR data acquisition, image reconstruction, post-processing and analysis; along with the development of promising AI-based biomarkers for a wide spectrum of cardiac conditions. The exponential rise in the availability and complexity of CMR data has fostered the development of different AI models. Integration in clinical routine in a meaningful way remains a challenge. Currently, innovations in this field are still mostly presented in proof-of-concept studies with emphasis on the engineering solutions; often recruiting small patient cohorts or relying on standardised databases such as Multi-ethnic Study on atherosclerosis (MESA), UK Biobank and others. The wider incorporation of clinically valid endpoints such as symptoms, survival, need and response to treatment remains to be seen. This review briefly summarises the current principles of AI employed in CMR and explores the relevant prospective observational studies in cardiology patient cohorts. It provides an overview of clinical studies employing undersampled reconstruction techniques to speed up the scan encompassing cine imaging, whole-heart imaging, multi-parametric mapping and magnetic resonance fingerprinting along with the clinical utility of AI applications in image post-processing, and analysis. Specific focus is given to studies that have incorporated CMR-derived prediction models for prognostication in cardiac disease. It also discusses current limitations and proposes potential developments to enable multi-disciplinary collaboration for improved evidence-based medicine. AI is an extremely promising field and the timely integration of clinician's input in the ingenious technical investigator's paradigm holds promise for a bright future in the medical field.},

CT angiography (CTA) has emerged as the most practical imaging modality to ensure accurate and prompt recognition of acute PEs. Thus, radiologists are positioned as the first physicians able to confirm a diagnosis of acute PE in clinically suspected cases. However, in addition to identifying acute PE on CTA, radiologists also must be aware of its mimics. Misdiagnosis of PE can result in detrimental patient outcomes, exposing patients unnecessarily to the risks of anticoagulation and delaying recognition of any true underlying pathology. In this article, we discuss entities that can be mistaken for acute PE on CTA. These mimics include artifacts, nonvascular abnormalities, and various causes of filling defects in the pulmonary vasculature, both thrombotic and nonthrombotic. The objectives of this article are to familiarize the reader with mimics of acute PE and to review the characteristic features that differentiate them from acute PE on CT.},

  abstract = {Large multimodal models (LMMs) extend large language models (LLMs) with multi-sensory skills, such as visual understanding, to achieve stronger generic intelligence. In this paper, we analyze the latest model, GPT-4V(ision) [99--101, 1]1, to deepen the understanding of LMMs. The analysis focuses on the intriguing tasks that GPT-4V can perform, containing test samples to probe the quality and genericity of GPT-4V's capabilities, its supported inputs and working modes, and the effective ways to prompt the model. In our approach to exploring GPT-4V, we curate and organize a collection of carefully designed qualitative samples spanning a variety of domains and tasks. Observations from these samples demonstrate that GPT-4V's unprecedented ability in processing arbitrarily interleaved multimodal inputs and the genericity of its capabilities together make GPT-4V a powerful multimodal generalist system. Furthermore, GPT-4V's unique capability of understanding visual markers drawn on input images can give rise to new humancomputer interaction methods such as visual referring prompting. We conclude the report with in-depth discussions on the emerging application scenarios and the future research directions for GPT-4V-based systems. We hope that this preliminary exploration will inspire future research on the next-generation multimodal task formulation, new ways to exploit and enhance LMMs to solve real-world problems, and gaining better understanding of multimodal foundation models. Finally, we acknowledge that the model under our study is solely the product of OpenAI's innovative work, and they should be fully credited for its development.

We present 9 cases with intracranial calcifications distributed in 2 brain regions: the frontal white matter adjacent to the anterior horns of the lateral ventricles and the parietal subcortical white matter. Thin-section (1-mm) CT scans are particularly helpful in detection due to the small size of the calcifications. These calcifications had a symmetric "stepping stone appearance" in the frontal pericallosal regions, which was clearly visible on reconstructed sagittal CT images. Intrafamilial variability was seen in 2 of the families, and calcifications were seen at birth in a single individual. These characteristic calcification patterns may assist in making a correct diagnosis and may contribute to understanding of the pathogenesis of leukoencephalopathy.},

  abstract = {Childhood obesity is an important public health problem, with a rapidly increasing frequency worldwide. Identification of critical periods for the development of childhood and adolescent obesity could be very useful for targeting prevention measures. Weight status in early childhood is a poor predictor of adult adiposity status, and most obese adults were not obese as children. We first proposed to use the body mass index (BMI) charts to monitor individual BMI development. The adiposity rebound (AR) corresponds to the second rise in BMI curve that occurs between ages 5 and 7 years. It is not as direct a measure as BMI at any age, but because it involves the examination of several points during growth, and because it is identified at a time when adiposity level clearly change directions, this method provides information that can help us understand individual changes and the development of health risks. An early AR is associated with an increased risk of overweight. It is inversely associated with bone age, and reflects accelerated growth. The early AR recorded in most obese subjects and the striking difference in the mean age at AR between obese subjects (3 years) and non-obese subjects (6 years) suggest that factors have operated very early in life. The typical pattern associated with an early AR is a low BMI followed by increased BMI level after the rebound. This pattern is recorded in children of recent generations as compared to those of previous generations. This is owing to the trend of a steeper increase of height as compared to weight in the first years of life. This typical BMI pattern (low, followed by high body fatness level) is associated with metabolic diseases such as diabetes and coronary heart diseases. Low body fatness before the AR suggests that an energy deficit had occurred at an early stage of growth. It can be attributable to the high-protein, low-fat diet fed to infants at a time of high energy needs, the former triggering height velocity and the latter decreasing the energy density of the diet and then reducing energy intake. The high-fat, low-protein content of human milk may contribute to its beneficial effects on growth processes. Early (pre- and postnatal) life is a critical period during which environmental factors may programme adaptive mechanisms that will persist in adulthood. Under-nutrition in fetal life or during the first years after birth may programme a thrifty metabolism that will exert adverse effects later in life, especially if the growing child is exposed to overnutrition. These observations stress the importance of an adequate nutritional status in childhood and the necessity to provide nutritional intakes adapted to nutritional needs at various stages of growth. Because the AR reflects particular BMI patterns, it is a useful tool for the paediatrician to monitor the child's adiposity development and for researchers to investigate the different developmental patterns leading to overweight. It contributes to the understanding of chronic disease programming and suggests new approaches to obesity prevention.},

While a small number of reports on imaging findings in routine MRI exist, reported imaging findings in DWI and spectroscopy are scarce, and limited to not genetically proven case reports. We assessed MRI including DWI and MR spectroscopy in six patients with HDLS and two asymptomatic mutation carriers. A total of 13 MRIs were evaluated and a score of the white-matter lesion (WML) load was calculated. The course of MR abnormalities was followed for 6--19~months in four patients and 95~months in one carrier. MRI revealed widespread white-matter lesions of patchy or confluent pattern especially in the frontal and occipital lobe. The pyramidal tract was less affected than the surrounding tissue in all symptomatic patients on conventional T2WI. Three of four cases with DWI showed small dots of diffusion restriction within WML. Spectroscopy showed increased levels of mIns, Cho and lactate while NAA was decreased. Asymptomatic mutation carriers had, for the age of the patients, unusually pronounced unspecific WMLs. No diffusion restriction or alterations in metabolite levels could be detected in asymptomatic mutation carriers. Microbleeds were not found in any patient. Diffusion restriction seems to be a typical imaging pattern visible in patients with active disease progression in HDLS. Spectroscopic findings and the absence of microbleeds differ clearly from reported findings in CADASIL and subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy. While the distribution and character of WMLs in asymptomatic cases remain unspecific they are likely to represent subclinical markers of HDLS.},

We need to be able to define optimal patterns of infant feeding, not just to support growth and development in infancy, but also as determinants of later health. To date, much of the focus on the long-term effects of infant nutrition on has been on milk feeding, to compare breast and formula feeding and to evaluate the effects of exclusivity, timing and duration of feeding different types of milk in infancy; other aspects of infant feeding such as age at introduction of solid foods and type of weaning diet have received less attention, and relatively little is known about their links to later health. Contemporary data are needed to enable us to move beyond explanation of historical infant feeding data, to understand and predict health outcomes in future generations. On-going and new population studies, that include infants from diverse settings, will be key to providing generalizable data that can be used to define optimal feeding practice. There are some methodological challenges ahead, although significant progress has already been made, and further progress is envisaged in the future. In particular, the opportunity to bring together epidemiological studies and new mechanistic insights, that will help to identify key aspects of infant nutrition and their causal effects, offer great promise both in moving this field forward as well as the potential for health benefits for future generations.},

In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in natural language. In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step. We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then move on to prompt optimization where the goal is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8\% on GSM8K, and by up to 50\% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.},

  abstract = {Web-crawled pretraining datasets underlie the impressive "zero-shot" evaluation performance of multimodal models, such as CLIP for classification/retrieval and Stable-Diffusion for image generation. However, it is unclear how meaningful the notion of "zero-shot" generalization is for such multimodal models, as it is not known to what extent their pretraining datasets encompass the downstream concepts targeted for during "zero-shot" evaluation. In this work, we ask: How is the performance of multimodal models on downstream concepts influenced by the frequency of these concepts in their pretraining datasets? We comprehensively investigate this question across 34 models and five standard pretraining datasets (CC-3M, CC-12M, YFCC-15M, LAION-400M, LAION-Aesthetics), generating over 300GB of data artifacts. We consistently find that, far from exhibiting "zero-shot" generalization, multimodal models require exponentially more data to achieve linear improvements in downstream "zero-shot" performance, following a sample inefficient log-linear scaling trend. This trend persists even when controlling for sample-level similarity between pretraining and downstream datasets, and testing on purely synthetic data distributions. Furthermore, upon benchmarking models on long-tailed data sampled based on our analysis, we demonstrate that multimodal models across the board perform poorly. We contribute this long-tail test set as the "Let it Wag!" benchmark to further research in this direction. Taken together, our study reveals an exponential need for training data which implies that the key to "zero-shot" generalization capabilities under large-scale training paradigms remains to be found.},

Nearly 900,000 new diagnoses are made each year, with 250,000 associated hospitalizations and up to 100,000 deaths (Palacio et al. in Semin Roentgenol 50(3):217--225, 2015; Metter et al. in Am J Roentgenol 208(3):489--494, 2017; Jaff et al. in Circulation 123(16):1788--830, 2011).

Recent Findings Computed tomography (CT) has emerged as the primary imaging modality used in the diagnosis of acute PE. Thus, radiologists play a key role in the correct diagnosis of acute PE, and must differentiate this diagnosis from other conditions that mimic the imaging findings of acute PE, as well as from artifacts associated with imaging techniques (Palacio et al. in Semin Roentgenol 50(3):217--225, 2015; Jaff et al. in Circulation 123(16):1788--830, 2011; Raja et al. in Ann Intern Med 163(9):701, 2015). Understanding how these diagnoses present on CT is necessary for improved patient care. Summary This article will discuss the diagnosis of acute PE with CT, the diagnosis of diseases that may be mistaken for acute PE, and how to identify imaging artifacts that may be mistaken for an acute PE.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE. Our goal was to use the results of a quantitative d-dimer assay to determine the need for pulmonary CT angiography in patients suspected of having acute pulmonary embolism. MATERIALS AND METHODS. From July 2001 to December 2002, 755 patients underwent pulmonary CT angiography for the evaluation of acute pulmonary embolism. A rapid, fully automated quantitative d-dimer assay was obtained in more than half the patients. The electronic medical records of the patients were subsequently reviewed to analyze the negative predictive value of the d-dimer assay in the diagnostic workup of acute pulmonary embolism and to determine the outcome of the patients who had negative findings on both d-dimer assay and pulmonary CT angiography at 3-month follow-up. RESULTS. Of the 755 patients who underwent pulmonary CT angiography, 666 (88.2\%) had negative findings, 73 (9.7\%) had positive findings, and 16 (2.1\%) were indeterminate. A total of 426 patients underwent both pulmonary CT angiography and d-dimer level evaluation, and 84 of these had negative findings ({$<$} 0.4 {$\mu$}g/mL) on d-dimer assay. Eighty-two of the 84 patients with negative findings on d-dimer assay had negative findings on pulmonary CT angiography; two were indeterminate and both subsequently had low-probability ventilation--perfusion studies. Among patients with positive d-dimer assays, no one with a level between 0.4 and 1.0 {$\mu$}g/mL had pulmonary CT angiography with findings positive for pulmonary embolism. CONCLUSION. A quantitative d-dimer assay was effective in excluding the need for pulmonary CT angiography and had high negative predictive value when the d-dimer level was less than 1.0 {$\mu$}g/mL.},
