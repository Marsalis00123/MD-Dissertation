  abstract = {Optimization is ubiquitous. While derivative-based algorithms have been powerful tools for various problems, the absence of gradient imposes challenges on many real-world applications. In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in natural language. In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step. We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then move on to prompt optimization where the goal is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8\% on GSM8K, and by up to 50\% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.},

  abstract = {Large multimodal models (LMMs) extend large language models (LLMs) with multi-sensory skills, such as visual understanding, to achieve stronger generic intelligence. In this paper, we analyze the latest model, GPT-4V(ision) [99--101, 1]1, to deepen the understanding of LMMs. The analysis focuses on the intriguing tasks that GPT-4V can perform, containing test samples to probe the quality and genericity of GPT-4V's capabilities, its supported inputs and working modes, and the effective ways to prompt the model. In our approach to exploring GPT-4V, we curate and organize a collection of carefully designed qualitative samples spanning a variety of domains and tasks. Observations from these samples demonstrate that GPT-4V's unprecedented ability in processing arbitrarily interleaved multimodal inputs and the genericity of its capabilities together make GPT-4V a powerful multimodal generalist system. Furthermore, GPT-4V's unique capability of understanding visual markers drawn on input images can give rise to new humancomputer interaction methods such as visual referring prompting. We conclude the report with in-depth discussions on the emerging application scenarios and the future research directions for GPT-4V-based systems. We hope that this preliminary exploration will inspire future research on the next-generation multimodal task formulation, new ways to exploit and enhance LMMs to solve real-world problems, and gaining better understanding of multimodal foundation models. Finally, we acknowledge that the model under our study is solely the product of OpenAI's innovative work, and they should be fully credited for its development.

  abstract = {Childhood obesity is an important public health problem, with a rapidly increasing frequency worldwide. Identification of critical periods for the development of childhood and adolescent obesity could be very useful for targeting prevention measures. Weight status in early childhood is a poor predictor of adult adiposity status, and most obese adults were not obese as children. We first proposed to use the body mass index (BMI) charts to monitor individual BMI development. The adiposity rebound (AR) corresponds to the second rise in BMI curve that occurs between ages 5 and 7 years. It is not as direct a measure as BMI at any age, but because it involves the examination of several points during growth, and because it is identified at a time when adiposity level clearly change directions, this method provides information that can help us understand individual changes and the development of health risks. An early AR is associated with an increased risk of overweight. It is inversely associated with bone age, and reflects accelerated growth. The early AR recorded in most obese subjects and the striking difference in the mean age at AR between obese subjects (3 years) and non-obese subjects (6 years) suggest that factors have operated very early in life. The typical pattern associated with an early AR is a low BMI followed by increased BMI level after the rebound. This pattern is recorded in children of recent generations as compared to those of previous generations. This is owing to the trend of a steeper increase of height as compared to weight in the first years of life. This typical BMI pattern (low, followed by high body fatness level) is associated with metabolic diseases such as diabetes and coronary heart diseases. Low body fatness before the AR suggests that an energy deficit had occurred at an early stage of growth. It can be attributable to the high-protein, low-fat diet fed to infants at a time of high energy needs, the former triggering height velocity and the latter decreasing the energy density of the diet and then reducing energy intake. The high-fat, low-protein content of human milk may contribute to its beneficial effects on growth processes. Early (pre- and postnatal) life is a critical period during which environmental factors may programme adaptive mechanisms that will persist in adulthood. Under-nutrition in fetal life or during the first years after birth may programme a thrifty metabolism that will exert adverse effects later in life, especially if the growing child is exposed to overnutrition. These observations stress the importance of an adequate nutritional status in childhood and the necessity to provide nutritional intakes adapted to nutritional needs at various stages of growth. Because the AR reflects particular BMI patterns, it is a useful tool for the paediatrician to monitor the child's adiposity development and for researchers to investigate the different developmental patterns leading to overweight. It contributes to the understanding of chronic disease programming and suggests new approaches to obesity prevention.},

We need to be able to define optimal patterns of infant feeding, not just to support growth and development in infancy, but also as determinants of later health. To date, much of the focus on the long-term effects of infant nutrition on has been on milk feeding, to compare breast and formula feeding and to evaluate the effects of exclusivity, timing and duration of feeding different types of milk in infancy; other aspects of infant feeding such as age at introduction of solid foods and type of weaning diet have received less attention, and relatively little is known about their links to later health. Contemporary data are needed to enable us to move beyond explanation of historical infant feeding data, to understand and predict health outcomes in future generations. On-going and new population studies, that include infants from diverse settings, will be key to providing generalizable data that can be used to define optimal feeding practice. There are some methodological challenges ahead, although significant progress has already been made, and further progress is envisaged in the future. In particular, the opportunity to bring together epidemiological studies and new mechanistic insights, that will help to identify key aspects of infant nutrition and their causal effects, offer great promise both in moving this field forward as well as the potential for health benefits for future generations.},

While a small number of reports on imaging findings in routine MRI exist, reported imaging findings in DWI and spectroscopy are scarce, and limited to not genetically proven case reports. We assessed MRI including DWI and MR spectroscopy in six patients with HDLS and two asymptomatic mutation carriers. A total of 13 MRIs were evaluated and a score of the white-matter lesion (WML) load was calculated. The course of MR abnormalities was followed for 6--19~months in four patients and 95~months in one carrier. MRI revealed widespread white-matter lesions of patchy or confluent pattern especially in the frontal and occipital lobe. The pyramidal tract was less affected than the surrounding tissue in all symptomatic patients on conventional T2WI. Three of four cases with DWI showed small dots of diffusion restriction within WML. Spectroscopy showed increased levels of mIns, Cho and lactate while NAA was decreased. Asymptomatic mutation carriers had, for the age of the patients, unusually pronounced unspecific WMLs. No diffusion restriction or alterations in metabolite levels could be detected in asymptomatic mutation carriers. Microbleeds were not found in any patient. Diffusion restriction seems to be a typical imaging pattern visible in patients with active disease progression in HDLS. Spectroscopic findings and the absence of microbleeds differ clearly from reported findings in CADASIL and subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy. While the distribution and character of WMLs in asymptomatic cases remain unspecific they are likely to represent subclinical markers of HDLS.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the area of knowledge that develops computerised models to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These algorithms are programmed to learn and identify patterns from "training data," that can be subsequently applied to new datasets, without being explicitly programmed to do so. AI is revolutionising the field of medical imaging and in particular of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) by providing deep learning solutions for image acquisition, reconstruction and analysis, ultimately supporting the clinical decision making. Numerous methods have been developed over recent years to enhance and expedite CMR data acquisition, image reconstruction, post-processing and analysis; along with the development of promising AI-based biomarkers for a wide spectrum of cardiac conditions. The exponential rise in the availability and complexity of CMR data has fostered the development of different AI models. Integration in clinical routine in a meaningful way remains a challenge. Currently, innovations in this field are still mostly presented in proof-of-concept studies with emphasis on the engineering solutions; often recruiting small patient cohorts or relying on standardised databases such as Multi-ethnic Study on atherosclerosis (MESA), UK Biobank and others. The wider incorporation of clinically valid endpoints such as symptoms, survival, need and response to treatment remains to be seen. This review briefly summarises the current principles of AI employed in CMR and explores the relevant prospective observational studies in cardiology patient cohorts. It provides an overview of clinical studies employing undersampled reconstruction techniques to speed up the scan encompassing cine imaging, whole-heart imaging, multi-parametric mapping and magnetic resonance fingerprinting along with the clinical utility of AI applications in image post-processing, and analysis. Specific focus is given to studies that have incorporated CMR-derived prediction models for prognostication in cardiac disease. It also discusses current limitations and proposes potential developments to enable multi-disciplinary collaboration for improved evidence-based medicine. AI is an extremely promising field and the timely integration of clinician's input in the ingenious technical investigator's paradigm holds promise for a bright future in the medical field.},

The protective effect of bradycardia in patients with reduced ejection fraction using beta-blockers or ivabradine does not improve symptoms in HFpEF. This review aims to assess current data regarding the impact of anti-bradycardia pacing in patients with HFpEF. A search was conducted on PubMed, ScienceDirect, Springer, and Wiley Online Library, selecting studies from 2013 to 2023. Relevant and eligible prospective studies and randomized controlled trials were included. Functional status, quality of life, and echocardiographic parameters were assessed. Six studies conformed to the selection criteria. Four were prospective studies with a total of 90 patients analyzed. Two were randomized controlled trials with a total of 129 patients assessed. The 6-min walk test (6MWT) and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) score improved in all prospective studies. My-PACE trial showed improvements in MLHFQ score (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), significant relative lowering in NT-proBNP levels (p\,=\,0.02), and an increased mean daily activity in the personalized accelerated pacing group compared to usual care. RAPID-HF trial proved that pacemaker implantation to enhance exercise heart rate (HR) did not improve exercise capacity and was associated with increased adverse events. HFpEF requires a more individualized approach and quality of life management. This review demonstrates that higher resting HR by atrial pacing may improve symptoms and even outcomes in HFpEF, while a higher adaptive rate during exertion has not been proven beneficial.},

  abstract = {Diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) can be challenging for both clinicians and radiologists. CT angiography (CTA) has emerged as the most practical imaging modality to ensure accurate and prompt recognition of acute PEs. Thus, radiologists are positioned as the first physicians able to confirm a diagnosis of acute PE in clinically suspected cases. However, in addition to identifying acute PE on CTA, radiologists also must be aware of its mimics. Misdiagnosis of PE can result in detrimental patient outcomes, exposing patients unnecessarily to the risks of anticoagulation and delaying recognition of any true underlying pathology. In this article, we discuss entities that can be mistaken for acute PE on CTA. These mimics include artifacts, nonvascular abnormalities, and various causes of filling defects in the pulmonary vasculature, both thrombotic and nonthrombotic. The objectives of this article are to familiarize the reader with mimics of acute PE and to review the characteristic features that differentiate them from acute PE on CT.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE. Our goal was to use the results of a quantitative d-dimer assay to determine the need for pulmonary CT angiography in patients suspected of having acute pulmonary embolism. MATERIALS AND METHODS. From July 2001 to December 2002, 755 patients underwent pulmonary CT angiography for the evaluation of acute pulmonary embolism. A rapid, fully automated quantitative d-dimer assay was obtained in more than half the patients. The electronic medical records of the patients were subsequently reviewed to analyze the negative predictive value of the d-dimer assay in the diagnostic workup of acute pulmonary embolism and to determine the outcome of the patients who had negative findings on both d-dimer assay and pulmonary CT angiography at 3-month follow-up. RESULTS. Of the 755 patients who underwent pulmonary CT angiography, 666 (88.2\%) had negative findings, 73 (9.7\%) had positive findings, and 16 (2.1\%) were indeterminate. A total of 426 patients underwent both pulmonary CT angiography and d-dimer level evaluation, and 84 of these had negative findings ({$<$} 0.4 {$\mu$}g/mL) on d-dimer assay. Eighty-two of the 84 patients with negative findings on d-dimer assay had negative findings on pulmonary CT angiography; two were indeterminate and both subsequently had low-probability ventilation--perfusion studies. Among patients with positive d-dimer assays, no one with a level between 0.4 and 1.0 {$\mu$}g/mL had pulmonary CT angiography with findings positive for pulmonary embolism. CONCLUSION. A quantitative d-dimer assay was effective in excluding the need for pulmonary CT angiography and had high negative predictive value when the d-dimer level was less than 1.0 {$\mu$}g/mL.},

  abstract = {Purpose of Review Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is the third most-common acute cardiovascular disease in the United States. Nearly 900,000 new diagnoses are made each year, with 250,000 associated hospitalizations and up to 100,000 deaths (Palacio et al. in Semin Roentgenol 50(3):217--225, 2015; Metter et al. in Am J Roentgenol 208(3):489--494, 2017; Jaff et al. in Circulation 123(16):1788--830, 2011). Timely and accurate diagnosis of acute PE is crucial for the prevention of most deaths associated with PE, even more so than optimal medical therapy (Palacio et al. in Semin Roentgenol 50(3):217--225, 2015; Jaff et al. in Circulation 123(16):1788--830, 2011; Raja et al. in Ann Intern Med 163(9):701, 2015). Recent Findings Computed tomography (CT) has emerged as the primary imaging modality used in the diagnosis of acute PE. Thus, radiologists play a key role in the correct diagnosis of acute PE, and must differentiate this diagnosis from other conditions that mimic the imaging findings of acute PE, as well as from artifacts associated with imaging techniques (Palacio et al. in Semin Roentgenol 50(3):217--225, 2015; Jaff et al. in Circulation 123(16):1788--830, 2011; Raja et al. in Ann Intern Med 163(9):701, 2015). Understanding how these diagnoses present on CT is necessary for improved patient care. Summary This article will discuss the diagnosis of acute PE with CT, the diagnosis of diseases that may be mistaken for acute PE, and how to identify imaging artifacts that may be mistaken for an acute PE.},

We present 9 cases with intracranial calcifications distributed in 2 brain regions: the frontal white matter adjacent to the anterior horns of the lateral ventricles and the parietal subcortical white matter. Thin-section (1-mm) CT scans are particularly helpful in detection due to the small size of the calcifications. These calcifications had a symmetric "stepping stone appearance" in the frontal pericallosal regions, which was clearly visible on reconstructed sagittal CT images. Intrafamilial variability was seen in 2 of the families, and calcifications were seen at birth in a single individual. These characteristic calcification patterns may assist in making a correct diagnosis and may contribute to understanding of the pathogenesis of leukoencephalopathy.},

  abstract = {Web-crawled pretraining datasets underlie the impressive "zero-shot" evaluation performance of multimodal models, such as CLIP for classification/retrieval and Stable-Diffusion for image generation. However, it is unclear how meaningful the notion of "zero-shot" generalization is for such multimodal models, as it is not known to what extent their pretraining datasets encompass the downstream concepts targeted for during "zero-shot" evaluation. In this work, we ask: How is the performance of multimodal models on downstream concepts influenced by the frequency of these concepts in their pretraining datasets? We comprehensively investigate this question across 34 models and five standard pretraining datasets (CC-3M, CC-12M, YFCC-15M, LAION-400M, LAION-Aesthetics), generating over 300GB of data artifacts. We consistently find that, far from exhibiting "zero-shot" generalization, multimodal models require exponentially more data to achieve linear improvements in downstream "zero-shot" performance, following a sample inefficient log-linear scaling trend. This trend persists even when controlling for sample-level similarity between pretraining and downstream datasets, and testing on purely synthetic data distributions. Furthermore, upon benchmarking models on long-tailed data sampled based on our analysis, we demonstrate that multimodal models across the board perform poorly. We contribute this long-tail test set as the "Let it Wag!" benchmark to further research in this direction. Taken together, our study reveals an exponential need for training data which implies that the key to "zero-shot" generalization capabilities under large-scale training paradigms remains to be found.},

  abstract = {Female dominance is often associated with lemurs. However, consensus does not exist among primatologists on how to define, measure, or explain female dominance. This review explores the utility of applying a broader concept of power to understanding lemur intersexual relationships. In this framework, power is defined as arising from an asymmetry in a dyadic relationship and can be divided into 2 types: dominance and leverage. Intersexual asymmetries based upon females having superior fighting ability are considered female dominance. However, economic power also exists, and females with resource-based power exhibit female leverage. Additionally, power has 4 characteristics (base, means, amount, and scope) that describe the precise nature of observed phenomena. This article utilizes the 4 characteristics outlined in the power framework to review the existing "female dominance" literature for lemurs and highlights the value of adopting both an expanded concept of power and a more precise language. By placing the multiple phenomena currently labeled under the single term "female dominance" within the power framework, much of the confusion disappears. Thus, not only is the debate reframed, facilitating endeavors to find evolutionary explanations, but the uniqueness of female power in lemurs can be determined empirically rather than by definition.},

Furthermore, key insights from large cohort trials have helped delineate cardiovascular disease risk as a function of overall coronary plaque burden and the morphological appearance of individual plaques. The advent of CT-derived fractional flow reserve promises to establish an anatomical and functional test within one modality. Recent data examining the short-term impact of CT-derived fractional flow reserve on downstream care and clinical outcomes have been published. In addition, machine learning is a concept that is being increasingly applied to diagnostic medicine. Over the coming decade, machine learning will begin to be integrated into cardiac CT, and will potentially make a tangible difference to how this modality evolves. The authors have performed an extensive literature review and comprehensive analysis of the recent advances in cardiac CT. They review how recent advances currently impact on clinical care and potential future directions for this imaging modality.},

CT provides consistent diagnostic support, mainly in suspected coronary disease in patients with a low or intermediate pre-test risk. Moreover, it can gain information in the case of cardiac involvement in pulmonary vascular obstructive disease. MRI, on the other hand, has a leading role in the condition of myocardial damage irrespective of the underlying inflammatory or stress related etiology.

Accordingly to these considerations, cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) asserts itself as a gold standard method for the anatomical evaluation of the heart and permits to evaluate, verify, measure and characterize structural pathological alterations of both congenital and acquired degenerative diseases. Accordingly, CCTA is increasingly used as a prognostic model capable of modifying the outcome of diseased patients in planning interventions and in the post-surgical/interventional follow-up.

Chest radiograph has limited utility, occasionally showing  ndings of PE or infarction, but is useful in evaluating other potential causes of chest pain. Ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan demonstrates ventilation-perfusion mismatches in these patients, with several classi cation schemes, typically ranging from normal to high. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also provides accurate diagnosis, but is available in only specialized centers and requires higher levels of expertise. Catheter pulmonary angiography is no longer used for diagnosis and is used only for interventional management. Echocardiography is used for risk strati cation of these patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS  PE severity was quantified using computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in 400 consecutive cases using the modified Miller score (1--5, mild; 6--11, moderate; 12--16, severe). Right ventricle strain was assessed using the right/left ventricle diameter (RV/LV) ratio. CAC score (CACS) was assessed using a four-point scale (CACS mild 1--3, moderate 4--8, severe 9--12) for each vessel and summed to give the total CACS. Follow-up for mortality was obtained at 3 years.    RESULTS  PE severity was classified as mild in 48\%, moderate in 21\%, and severe in 32\% of cases. The median modified Miller score was 6 (Interquartile range [IQR] 2, 14) and median total CACS was 2 (IQR 0, 7). All-cause mortality occurred in 128 (32\%) patients. Patients with CAC were three times more likely to die than patients without CAC (Hazard ratio [HR] 2.96; 95\% CI 1.84, 4.77; p    CONCLUSION  CACS is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in patients with PE, and has important implications for subsequent patient management.},

  abstract = {Introduction  Current evaluation of patients suspected of a non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) involves the use of algorithms that incorporate clinical information, electrocardiogram (ECG) and high-sensitivity cardiac troponins (hs-troponins). While primarily designed to rule out NSTE-ACS safely, these algorithms can also be used for rule in of NSTE-ACS in some patients. Still, in a substantial number of patients, these algorithms do not provide a conclusive work-up. These patients often present with an atypical clinical profile and low-range positive hs-troponin values without a characteristic rise or fall pattern. They represent a heterogeneous group of patients with various underlying conditions; only a fraction (30\%--40\%) will eventually be diagnosed with a myocardial infarction. Uncertainty exists about the optimal diagnostic strategy and their management depends on the clinical perspective of the treating physician ranging from direct discharge to admission for invasive coronary angiography. Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is a non-invasive test that has been shown to be safe, fast and reliable in the evaluation of coronary artery disease. In this study, we will determine the usefulness of CCTA in patients with acute chest pain and low-range positive hs-troponin values.  Methods and analysis  A prospective, double-blind, observational, multicentre study conducted in the Netherlands. Patients aged 30--80 years presenting to the emergency department with acute chest pain and a suspicion of NSTE-ACS, a normal or non-diagnostic ECG and low-range positive hs-troponins will be scheduled to undergo CCTA. The primary outcome is the diagnostic accuracy of CCTA for the diagnosis of NSTE-ACS at discharge, in terms of sensitivity and negative predictive value.  Ethics and dissemination  This study was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee of Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands (registration number MEC-2017-506). Written informed consent to participate will be obtained from all participants. This study's findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

  abstract = {Cardiac MRI plays an important role in the evaluation of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, congenital disease, pericardial disease, and masses. Large multicenter trials have shown the positive impact of MRI-based management on outcomes in several CVDs. These results have made MRI an indispensable technique in the evaluation of these diseases, and cardiac MRI has an important role in multisociety guidelines. MRI is the reference standard for quantification of ventricular volumes and function. Flow imaging enables accurate quantification of flow and velocities through valves, shunts, and surgical conduits or baffles. Late gadolinium enhancement and parametric mapping techniques enable tissue characterization and yield prognostic information. In the past decade, cardiac MRI technology has seen rapid advances in both hardware and sequences. Multiple novel sequences, such as parametric mapping and four-dimensional flow, are increasingly being incorporated into routine clinical practice. Acceleration strategies have matured, allowing faster acquisition of cardiac MRI sequences in patients with arrhythmia and poor breath holding. Challenges of cardiac MRI at high-field-strength magnets and in patients with indwelling cardiac devices or severe renal dysfunction have been mitigated. Artificial intelligence techniques are decreasing the complexity of MRI acquisition and postprocessing.

  abstract = {Chapter 85 reviews the radiologic features of pyogenic spondylodiscitis and the diagnostic value of different imaging modalities such as conventional radiography, CT, MRI, and bone scintigraphy. Pyogenic spondylodiscitis is an infection of the intervertebral disc and adjacent vertebrae and may involve the paravertebral soft tissue and epidural space. The indolent clinical presentation poses a challenge in early diagnosis and management. Pyogenic spondylodiscitis can be diagnosed based on clinical findings and blood and tissue cultures and is supported by radiological and histopathologic findings. This chapter also reviews the imaging differential diagnoses, including tuberculous spondylodiscitis and malignancies. Imaging plays a crucial role in early diagnosis of disease and in demonstrating the extent of the disease process, as treatment delay significantly reduces the cure rate and increases the complication and morbidity rates.},

Although the low mortality, high morbidity is related to spondilodiscitys, leading spine instability, chronic pain or neurological deficit. Diagnostic imaging plays a primary role in diagnosing spondylodiscitis. However different accuracy is highlighted by different diagnostic tool, depending also on timing of disease which represents a cardinal element for the phenotypic manifestation of the disease, beyond spatial resolution and tissue characterization proper of specific modality imaging. Conventional Radiology (CR), Computed Tomography (CT) and MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) all have proven to be of primary importance in the approach to spondylodiscitis, although magnetic resonance imaging has demonstrated the greatest advantage in identifying the disease from its earliest stages, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity (92\% and 96\%, respectively). This review focus on the role of different imaging modality in the approach to the spondylodiscitis, also addressing the role of interventional radiology that is pivotal not only for a diagnosis of certainty through biopsy, but also for a minimally-invasive treatment of paravertebral abscesses spondylodiscitis-related.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A recent population-based study from Denmark showed that the incidence of spondylodiscitis rose from 2.2 to 5.8 per 100 000 persons per year over the period 1995-2008; the age-standardized incidence in Germany has been estimated at 30 per 250 000 per year on the basis of data from the Federal Statistical Office (2015). The early diagnosis and treatment of this condition are essential to give the patient the best chance of a good outcome, but these are often delayed because it tends to present with nonspecific manifestations, and fever is often absent. METHODS: This article is based on a systematic search of Medline and the Cochrane Library for the period January 2009 to March 2017. Of the 788 articles identified, 30 publications were considered. RESULTS: The goals of treatment for spondylodiscitis are to eliminate infection, restore functionality of the spine, and relieve pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains the gold standard for the radiological demonstration of this condition, with 92\% sensitivity and 96\% specificity. It also enables visualization of the spatial extent of the infection and of abscess formation (if present). The most common bacterial cause of spondylodiscitis in Europe is Staphylococcus aureus, but tuberculous spondylodiscitis is the most common type worldwide. Antibiotic therapy is a pillar of treatment for spondylodiscitis and should be a part of the treatment in all cases. Neurologic deficits, sepsis, an intraspinal empyema, the failure of conservative treatment, and spinal instability are all indications for surgical treatment. CONCLUSION: The quality of life of patients who have been appropriately treated for spondylodiscitis has been found to be highly satisfactory in general, although back pain often persists. The risk of recurrence increases in the presence of accompanying illnesses such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, or undrained epidural abscesses.},

A review of the literature was done to advance our understanding of the diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of these infections. The principles of conservative treatment are to establish an accurate microbiological diagnosis, treat with appropriate antibiotics, immobilize the spine, and closely monitor for spinal instability and neurological deterioration. The purpose of surgical treatment is to obtain multiple intraoperative cultures of bone and soft tissue, perform a thorough debridement of infected tissue and decompression of neural structures, and reconstruct the unstable spinal column with bone graft with or without concomitant instrumentation. Appropriate management requires aggressive medical treatment and, at times, surgical interventions. If recognized early and treated appropriately, a full recovery can often be expected.

We sought to assess the diagnostic value of (18)F-FDG PET combined with MRI (combined (18)F-FDG PET/MRI) in patients with suspected spondylodiskitis and an inconclusive clinical or MRI presentation. METHODS: In a prospective study, 30 patients with previous inconclusive MRI results and suspected spondylodiskitis underwent combined (18)F-FDG PET/MRI, including precontrast and postcontrast standard spine MRI sequences. The image datasets were evaluated on dedicated workstations by 2 radiology residents and 1 board-certified nuclear medicine physician independently and then in consensus. Because of severe susceptibility artifacts, only 28 of 30 image datasets were evaluable, with a total of 29 regions of suspected spondylodiskitis. SUV ratios (affected disk/reference disk) were determined. The imaging results were compared with histopathology or clinical follow-up as a reference standard and subjected to statistical analysis. RESULTS: The reference standards identified spondylodiskitis in 12 disks and excluded spondylodiskitis in 17 disks. For MRI alone, the sensitivity was 50\%, the specificity was 71\%, the positive predictive value was 54\%, and the negative predictive value was 67\%. Adding the PET data resulted in sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 100\%, 88\%, 86\%, and 100\%, respectively. In a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, an SUVmax ratio threshold of 2.1 resulted in 92\% sensitivity and 88\% specificity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.95). Neither the level of C-reactive protein nor the leukocyte count at the time of PET/MRI was related to the reference standard diagnosis of spondylodiskitis. CONCLUSION: In patients with inconclusive clinical or MRI findings, the use of (18)F-FDG PET/MRI significantly increased diagnostic certainty for the detection of spondylodiskitis.},

This increase might reflect a progressively more susceptible population but also the availability of increased diagnostic accuracy. Yet, even with improved diagnosis tools and procedures, the delay in diagnosis remains an important issue. This review aims to highlight the importance of a methodological attitude towards accurate and prompt diagnosis using an algorithm to aid on spinal infection management. METHODS: Appropriate literature on spinal infection was selected using databases from the US National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health. RESULTS: Literature reveals that histopathological analysis of infected tissues is a paramount for diagnosis and must be performed routinely. Antibiotic therapy is transversal to both conservative and surgical approaches and must be initiated after etiological diagnosis. Indications for surgical treatment include neurological deficits or sepsis, spine instability and/or deformity, presence of epidural abscess and upon failure of conservative treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A methodological assessment could lead to diagnosis effectiveness of spinal infection. Towards this, we present a management algorithm based on literature findings.},

PURPOSE: To evaluate CT-guided percutaneous drainage within the intervertebral space for pyogenic spondylodiscitis and a secondary psoas abscess in which the two sites appear to communicate. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight patients with pyogenic spondylodiscitis and a secondary psoas abscess showing communication with the intradiscal abscess underwent CT-guided percutaneous drainage within the intervertebral space. The clinical outcome was retrospectively assessed. RESULTS: An 8-French pigtail catheter within the intervertebral space was successfully placed in all patients. Seven patients responded well to this treatment. The one remaining patient who had developed septic shock before the procedure died on the following day. The mean duration of drainage was 32 days (13-70 days). Only one patient with persistent back pain underwent surgery for stabilization of the spine after the improvement of inflammation. Among seven patients responding well, long-term follow-up (91-801 days, mean 292 days) was conducted in six patients excluding one patient who died of asphyxiation due to aspiration unrelated to the procedure within 30 days after the procedure. In these six patients, no recurrence of either pyogenic spondylodiscitis or the psoas abscess was noted. CONCLUSION: CT-guided percutaneous drainage within the intervertebral space can be effective for patients with pyogenic spondylodiscitis and a secondary psoas abscess if the psoas abscess communicates with the intradiscal abscess.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lumbar discitis-osteomyelitis has imaging characteristics than can overlap with noninfectious causes of back pain. Our aim was to determine the added accuracy of psoas musculature T2 hyperintensity (imaging psoas sign) in the MR imaging diagnosis of lumbar discitis-osteomyelitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective case-control study evaluated lumbar spine MR imaging examinations, during a 30-month period, that were requested for the evaluation of discitis-osteomyelitis. Of this pool, 50 age-matched control patients were compared with 51 biopsy-proved or clinically diagnosed patients with discitis-osteomyelitis. Two reviewers, blinded to the clinical information, assessed the randomly organized MR imaging examinations for abnormalities of the psoas musculature, vertebral bodies, discs, and epidural space. RESULTS: Psoas T2 hyperintensity demonstrated a high sensitivity (92.1\%; 95\% CI, 80\%-97.4\%) and specificity (92\%; 95\% CI, 80\%-97.4\%), high positive likelihood ratio (11.5; 95\% CI, 4.5-29.6), low negative likelihood ratio (0.09; 95\% CI, 0.03-0.20), and individual area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92; 95\% CI, 0.87-0.97. Identification of psoas T2 abnormality significantly improved (P = .02) the diagnostic accuracy of discitis-osteomyelitis in noncontrast examinations from an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of the established variables (vertebral body T2 and T1 signal, endplate integrity, disc T2 signal, and disc height) from 0.93 (95\% CI, 0.88-0.98) to 0.98 (95\% CI, 0.96-1.0). Psoas T2 abnormalities also had the highest interobserver reliability with a {$\kappa$} coefficient of 0.78 (substantial agreement). CONCLUSIONS: Psoas T2 hyperintensity, the imaging psoas sign, is highly correlated with discitis-osteomyelitis. T2 hyperintensity in the psoas musculature, particularly when there is clinical suspicion of spinal infection, improves the diagnostic accuracy of discitis-osteomyelitis compared with routine noncontrast variables alone.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To systematically evaluate magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings described as being indicative of spinal infection in patients with proven spinal infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Contrast material-enhanced spinal MR images obtained in 46 consecutive patients (22 women, 24 men; mean age, 58.2 years) with culture or histologic examination results positive for spinal infection were systematically evaluated by two observers. Tuberculous and postoperative infections were excluded. Disk signal intensity and disk height, presence of the nuclear cleft, vertebral signal intensity alterations, endplate erosions on T1-weighted MR images, and presence of paraspinal or epidural inflammation were evaluated. Patient charts and surgical reports were reviewed. RESULTS: In the 44 patients with disk infection, MR imaging criteria with good to excellent sensitivity included presence of paraspinal or epidural inflammation (n = 43, 97.7\% sensitivity), disk enhancement (n = 42, 95.4\% sensitivity), hyperintensity or fluid-equivalent disk signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images (n = 41, 93.2\% sensitivity), and erosion or destruction of at least one vertebral endplate (n = 37, 84.1\% sensitivity). Effacement of the nuclear cleft was only applicable in 18 patients (n = 15, 83.3\% sensitivity). Criteria with low sensitivity included decreased height of the intervertebral space (n = 23, 52.3\% sensitivity) and disk hypointensity on T1-weighted MR images (n = 13, 29.5\% sensitivity). Involvement of several spinal levels occurred in seven (16\%) patients. Other spinal infections included isolated vertebral osteomyelitis (n = 1) and primary epidural abscess (n = 1). CONCLUSION: Most MR imaging criteria commonly used to diagnose disk infections offer good to excellent sensitivity. In atypical manifestations of proven spinal infections, however, some of the classically described MR imaging criteria may not be observed.},

  abstract = {Osteomyelitis is an infection-related inflammatory disease of the bones. Imaging and laboratory results are typically used to support a clinical diagnosis of osteomyelitis. Microbial cultures and bone biopsies provide conclusive diagnoses. The first imaging procedure that needs to be done is radiography, but its sensitivity is low in the early stages of the disease. The sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging, both with and without contrast material, is higher for detecting areas of bone necrosis in advanced stages. Patients can be categorised for surgical treatment using a staging system based on major and minor risk factors. The main course of treatment should be antibiotics, which should be chosen depending on the findings of the culture and the characteristics of each patient. Bony debridement surgery is frequently required, and in high-risk patients or those with severe illness, additional surgical intervention can be necessary. Better outcomes are being attained in the treatment of this illness thanks to advancements in surgical treatment, antibiotic therapy, and the current resources for precise diagnosis and tailored responses to each kind of osteomyelitis. The classification systems that are most frequently employed, as well as the general epidemiological ideas, are presented together with the discussion of acute and chronic osteomyelitis. The key recommendations for diagnosing infections clinically, in the laboratory, and through imaging are covered, along with the recommendations for surgical and antibiotic procedures, and the function of hyperbaric oxygen as adjuvant therapy. We evaluate the osteomyelitis-related articles, summarise the most recent developments in diagnostic procedures and therapeutic regimens, evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of various diagnostic modalities~and therapeutic approaches, and suggest areas of focus to help current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.},

  abstract = {AIM: The diagnosis, severity and extent of a sterile inflammation or a septic infection could be challenging since there is not one single test able to achieve an accurate diagnosis. The clinical use of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging in the assessment of inflammation and infection is increasing worldwide. The purpose of this paper is to achieve an Italian consensus document on [18F]FDG PET/CT or PET/MRI in inflammatory and infectious diseases, such as osteomyelitis (OM), prosthetic joint infections (PJI), infective endocarditis (IE), prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE), cardiac implantable electronic device infections (CIEDI), systemic and cardiac sarcoidosis (SS/CS), diabetic foot (DF), fungal infections (FI), tuberculosis (TBC), fever and inflammation of unknown origin (FUO/IUO), pediatric infections (PI), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), spine infections (SI), vascular graft infections (VGI), large vessel vasculitis (LVV), retroperitoneal fibrosis (RF) and COVID-19 infections. METHODS: In September 2020, the inflammatory and infectious diseases focus group (IIFG) of the Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine (AIMN) proposed to realize a procedural paper about the clinical applications of [18F]FDG PET/CT or PET/MRI in inflammatory and infectious diseases. The project was carried out thanks to the collaboration of 13 Italian nuclear medicine centers, with a consolidate experience in this field. With the endorsement of AIMN, IIFG contacted each center, and the pediatric diseases focus group (PDFC). IIFG provided for each team involved, a draft with essential information regarding the execution of [18F]FDG PET/CT or PET/MRI scan (i.e., indications, patient preparation, standard or specific acquisition modalities, interpretation criteria, reporting methods, pitfalls and artifacts), by limiting the literature research to the last 20~years. Moreover, some clinical cases were required from each center, to underline the teaching points. Time for the collection of each report was from October to December 2020. RESULTS: Overall, we summarized 291 scientific papers and guidelines published between 1998 and 2021. Papers were divided in several sub-topics and summarized in the following paragraphs: clinical indications, image interpretation criteria, future perspectivess and new trends (for each single disease), while patient preparation, image acquisition, possible pitfalls and reporting modalities were described afterwards. Moreover, a specific section was dedicated to pediatric and PET/MRI indications. A collection of images was described for each indication. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, [18F]FDG PET/CT in oncology is globally accepted and standardized in main diagnostic algorithms for neoplasms. In recent years, the ever-closer collaboration among different European associations has tried to overcome the absence of a standardization also in the field of inflammation and infections. The collaboration of several nuclear medicine centers with a long experience in this field, as well as among different AIMN focus groups represents a further attempt in this direction. We hope that this document will be the basis for a "common nuclear physicians' language" throughout all the country. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40336-021-00445-w.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus caprae (Sc) is an uncommon causative organism for human. Lumbar pyogenic spondylodiscitis (LPS) of Sc is extremely rare and only a few cases have been reported. As far as we know, there is no specific literature on the diagnosis and treatment for LPS of Sc with L5 nerve root irritation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old male patient complained of chronic low back pain for 10~years, acute worsening with radiating pain to left lower extremity over a month. Physical examination revealed tenderness point on his low back, 3/5 dorsiflexor strength in his left 1st toe and decreased sensation of pin prick over the left lateral shank and medial dorsal foot. The individual was initially misdiagnosed with lumbar disc herniation (LDH) without further examination in outpatient, which was then found to be LPS of Sc with L5 nerve root irritation after admission to our hospital. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) of lumbar spine exhibited inflammation signal at L4-L5 level of the vertebral body and disc with hypointense on T1-weighted images (T1-WI) and hyperintense on T2-weighted images (T2-WI). The causative organism was confirmed by the culture of irrigation fluid obtained from L5 vertebrae by needle puncture. After systemic conservative treatment including using sensitive antimicrobial agents and immobilization, the rare infection was finally cured. The patient also showed a satisfactory recovery during the 36-month follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Confirming the diagnosis and identifying the causative organism as soon as possible is the key point for the treatment of LPS. LPS of Sc causing nerve root irritation is rare but curable with early diagnosis and proper therapy. The culture of irrigation fluid obtained from vertebrae by needle puncture may be an effective and sensitive attempt for potential infection of spine to identify the causative organism at early stage of the disease.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of nonspecific pyogenic spondylodiskitis, associated with both a high morbidity and a high mortality, has increased in the last few decades. The diagnosis is often delayed because of the nonspecific clinical manifestation at the early stage. The reliability of radiographs is limited, particularly in early stage after the onset of infection. Computed tomography (CT) can reliably assess the bony condition with the possibility of spatial visualization. Contrast enhancement supports the detection of affected soft tissue. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) continues to be the gold standard in the diagnosis of spondylodiskitis. Sophisticated investigation protocols supported by gadolinium enhancement secure the diagnosis. MRI has a high resolution without radiation exposure. Different nuclear investigation techniques extend the diagnostic options. Reports of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (18-FDG-PET) are particularly promising to confirm the diagnosis. The drawback of the reduced image quality with respect to detailed anatomical information can be overcome by a combined simultaneous acquisition of CT or MRI. With respect to one of the greatest challenges, the differentiation between degenerative changes (Modic type 1) and infection at an early stage using differentiated MRI protocols and FDG-PET is promising. This overview presents a concise state-of-the-art look at radiologic investigations in case of suspected nonspecific pyogenic spondylodiskitis with the focus on a pragmatic approach.},

  abstract = {Spondylodiscitis is defined by infectious conditions involving the vertebral column. The incidence of the disease has constantly increased over the last decades. Imaging plays a key role in each phase of the disease. Indeed, radiological tools are fundamental in (i) the initial diagnostic recognition of spondylodiscitis, (ii) the differentiation against inflammatory, degenerative, or calcific etiologies, (iii) the disease staging, as well as (iv) to provide clues to orient towards the microorganisms involved. This latter aim can be achieved with a mini-invasive procedure (e.g., CT-guided biopsy) or can be non-invasively supposed by the analysis of the CT, positron emission tomography (PET) CT, or MRI features displayed. Hence, this comprehensive review aims to summarize all the multimodality imaging features of spondylodiscitis. This, with the goal of serving as a reference for Physicians (infectious disease specialists, spine surgeons, radiologists) involved in the care of these patients.

  abstract = {MR imaging is the modality of choice for the detection, staging, and differential diagnosis of inflammatory disorders of the spine. Infectious spondylitis is characterized by the involvement of two adjacent vertebrae and the intervening disk with severe BME and early destruction of the end plates. The disk space is narrowed and typically exhibits water-equivalent signal intensity on T2-weighted or STIR images. Prevertebral and epidural extensions, abscess formation, enhancement of the BME, the disk space, and the surrounding granulation tissue are well demonstrated by gadolinium-enhanced images. Cervical spondylitis frequently involves more than one level. Bone marrow abnormalities may be subtle at this level and increased signal intensity of the disk space on T2-weighted or STIR images is an important finding. The risk for neurologic complications is increased. Granulomatous infections caused by tuberculosis, brucellosis, fungi, and parasites, including hydatid disease (Echinococcus), are frequently associated with imaging findings different from those seen with nonspecific bacterial infection. In patients with chronic infectious spondylitis, diffuse reactive bone marrow changes with decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted images, increased signal intensity on T2-weighted and STIR images, and increased uptake after gadolinium administration may occur. This phenomenon is probably caused by reactive bone marrow stimulation, simulating diffuse hematologic neoplastic disease. Erosive intervertebral osteochondrosis with bandlike disk gadolinium enhancement and BME, which is commonly associated with local pain, is the most important differential diagnosis of bacterial spondylitis.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To develop recommendations about identifying the causative organism, obtaining imaging studies, and selecting pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments in adults with pyogenic discitis and vertebral osteomyelitis (PDVO). METHODS: A rheumatologist and an infectiologist drafted recommendations based on their personal experience and a review of studies in English or French retrieved on Medline using the following search terms: "infectious spondylodiscitis", "infectious spondylitis", "spondylodiscitis", "discitis", "vertebral osteomyelitis", "spine infection", and "bone and joint infections". The recommendations were submitted to four experts for validation. RESULTS: 85 articles were selected for detailed review. No prospective randomized controlled trials were identified. Antimicrobial therapy should be initiated only after recovery of the causative organism in blood cultures or percutaneous disk biopsy specimens, except in patients with neutropenia or severe sepsis. The initial treatment rests on a combination of two bactericidal and synergistic antimicrobials in high dosages. The total duration of antimicrobial therapy should be 12 weeks at least. Radiographs of the spine and chest and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine should be performed routinely during the initial evaluation. In PDVO due to hematogenous dissemination of a streptococcus or staphylococcus, routine echocardiography may be in order. Radiographs centered on the affected disk should be obtained 1 and 3 months into antimicrobial therapy and 3 months after treatment discontinuation. Follow-up MRI is usually unnecessary when the clinical and laboratory abnormalities respond to treatment. If not, or if the initial investigations show a collected abscess, a repeat MRI after 1 month of antimicrobial treatment may be useful. Clinical and laboratory follow-up is mandatory throughout antimicrobial therapy and during the first 6 months after treatment discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations based on descriptive studies and expert opinion were developed. They can be expected to improve the quality and uniformity of PDVO management. Further studies are needed to improve the level of evidence that is available for developing recommendations. In particular, prospective randomized multicenter studies should be performed to compare the intravenous to the oral route for initial antimicrobials administration and to compare different treatment durations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred imaging modality for diagnosing pyogenic spinal infection (PSI), but it is not always available. Our objective was to describe pyogenic spinal infection imaging characteristics in patients presenting to a community emergency department (ED) and estimate the computed tomography (CT) sensitivity for these infections. METHODS: We examined the MRI reports from a cohort of 88 PSI patients whom we enrolled in a prospective cohort study and report the prevalence of each PSI type (spinal epidural abscess/infection, vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis, septic facet, and paravertebral abscess/infection) according to contemporary nomenclature. In a 14 patient subcohort who underwent both CT and MRI studies, we report the sensitivity for each PSI from a post hoc blinded overread of the CT imaging by a single neuroradiologist. RESULTS: Of the 88 PSI patients, the median age was 55 years, and 31\% were female. The PSI prevalence included: spinal epidural abscess/infection (SEA) in 61(69\%), vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis (VO/D) in 54 (61\%), septic facet (SF) in 15 (17\%), and paravertebral abscess/infection (PVA) in 53 (60\%). Of the SEAs, 82\% (50/61) were associated with other spinal infections, while 18\% (11/61) were isolated SEAs. The overall CT sensitivity in a masked overread was 79\% (11/14) for any PSI, 83\% (10/12) for any infection outside the spinal canal, and only 18\% (2/11) for SEA. CONCLUSION: Patients found to have vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis, septic facet, and paravertebral infections frequently had a SEA coinfection. CT interpretation by a neuroradiologist had moderate sensitivity for infections outside the spinal canal but had low sensitivity for SEA.},

We discuss the pathophysiology of spinal infection in various patient populations (including the non-instrumented and postoperative spine) as well as the role of imaging-guided biopsy. We also highlight several non-infectious entities that can mimic IS (both clinically and radiologically) that should be considered during image interpretation to avoid misdiagnosis.

  abstract = {Background: The diagnosis of acute spondylodiscitis can be very difficult because clinical onset symptoms are highly variable. The reference examination is MRI, but very often the first diagnostic investigation performed is CT, given its high availability in the acute setting. CT allows rapid evaluation of other alternative diagnoses (e.g., fractures), but scarce literature is available to evaluate the accuracy of CT, and in particular of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT), in the diagnosis of suspected spondylodiscitis. The aim of our study was to establish MDCT accuracy and how this diagnostic method could help doctors in the depiction of acute spondylodiscitis in an emergency situation by comparing the diagnostic performance of MDCT with MRI, which is the gold standard. Methods: We searched our radiological archive for all MRI examinations of patients who had been studied for a suspicion of acute spondylodiscitis in the period between January 2017 and January 2021 (n = 162). We included only patients who had undergone MDCT examination prior to MRI examination (n = 25). The overall diagnostic value of MDCT was estimated, using MRI as the gold standard. In particular, the aim of our study was to clarify the effectiveness of CT in radiological cases that require immediate intervention (stage of complications). Therefore, the radiologist, faced with a negative CT finding, can suggest an elective (not urgent) MRI with relative serenity and without therapeutic delays. Results: MDCT allowed identification of the presence of acute spondylodiscitis in 13 of 25 patients. Specificity and positive predictive value were 100\% for MDCT, while sensitivity and negative predictive value were 68\% and 50\%, respectively, achieving an overall accuracy of 76\%. In addition, MDCT allowed the identification of paravertebral abscesses (92\%), fairly pathognomonic lesions of spondylodiscitis pathology. Conclusions: The MDCT allows identification of the presence of acute spondylodiscitis in the Emergency Department (ED) with a satisfactory accuracy. In the case of a positive CT examination, this allows therapy to be started immediately and reduces complications. However, we suggest performing an elective MRI examination in negative cases in which pathological findings are hard to diagnose with CT alone.},

  abstract = {Spondylodiscitis is a spine infection for which a diagnosis by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the most appropriate imaging technique. The aim of this study was to compare the role of an 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) and an MRI in this field. For 56 patients with suspected spondylodiscitis for whom MRI and 18F-FDG PET/CT were performed, we retrospectively analyzed the results. Cohen's {$\kappa$} was applied to evaluate the agreement between the two techniques in all patients and in subgroups with a different number of spinal districts analyzed by the MRI. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were also evaluated. The agreements of the 18F-FDG PET/CT and MRI in the evaluation of the entire population, whole-spine MRI, and two-districts MRI were moderate ({$\kappa$} = 0.456, {$\kappa$} = 0.432, and {$\kappa$} = 0.429, respectively). In patients for whom one-district MRI was performed, 18F-FDG PET/CT and MRI were both positive and completely concordant ({$\kappa$} = 1). We also separately evaluated patients with suspected spondylodiscitis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis for whom the MRI and 18F-FDG PET/CT were always concordant excepting in 2 of the 18 (11\%) patients. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the MRI and 18F-FDG PET/CT were 100\%, 60\%, 97\%, and 92\%, 100\%, and 94\%, respectively. Our results confirmed the 18F-FDG PET/CT diagnostic value in the diagnosis of spondylodiscitis is comparable to that of MRI for the entire spine evaluation. This could be considered a complementary technique or a valid alternative to MRI.},

  abstract = {While nowadays, CT-guided bone biopsy represents the gold standard tool for histopathological and microbiological diagnosis of skeletal lesions, the role of US-guided bone biopsy has not yet been fully explored. US-guided biopsy offers several advantages, such as the absence of ionizing radiation, fast acquisition time, as well as good intra-lesional echo, and structural and vascular characterization. Despite that, a consensus in regard to its applications in bone neoplasms has not been established. Indeed CT-guided technique (or fluoroscopic ones) still represents the standard choice in clinical practice. This review article aims to review the literature data about US-guided bone biopsy, underlying clinical-radiological indications, advantages of the procedure and future perspectives. Bone lesions taking the best advantages of the US-guided biopsy are osteolytic, determining the erosion of the overlying bone cortex and/or with an extraosseous soft-tissue component. Indeed, osteolytic lesions with extra-skeletal soft-tissue involvement represent a clear indication for US-guided biopsy. Moreover, even lytic bone lesions with cortical thinning and/or cortical disruption, especially located in the extremities or pelvis, can be safely sampled with US guidance with very good diagnostic yield. US-guided bone biopsy is proven to be fast, effective and safe. Additionally, it offers real-time needle evaluation, an advantage when compared to CT-guided bone biopsy. In the current clinical settings, it seems relevant to select the exact eligibility criteria for this imaging guidance since the effectiveness can vary depending on the type of lesion and body site involved.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic yield of computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous needle aspiration procedures in the setting of suspected spontaneous infectious diskitis and to assess the usefulness of concurrent cytologic examination as a supplement to microbiologic evaluation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed to evaluate 105 consecutive CT-guided percutaneous disk space aspiration procedures in 92 patients suspected of having spontaneous (non-postoperative) infectious diskitis. Our criterion standard for the presence of active infection was the identification of a pathogen either from the CT-guided aspiration specimen or from a surgical specimen. All cases had microbiologic analysis, 78 cases had cytopathologic analysis, and 31 cases had open surgery. RESULTS: Microbiologic analysis of the CT-guided percutaneous aspiration specimens was positive in 39 of 43 cases proved to have active infections, with four false-negative and no false-positive cases (sensitivity, 91\%; specificity, 100\%). The false-negative cases were all active fungal infections identified from surgical specimens. Adding cytopathologic analysis to microbiologic analysis improved sensitivity but reduced specificity. The most common pathogens were species of Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Candida, and Mycobacterium. All 30 active bacterial infections were identified with the CT-guided procedures, but only five of nine fungal infections were identified. CONCLUSION: CT-guided percutaneous needle aspiration is an accurate method for identifying active bacterial disk space infections but is less reliable for identifying fungal infections.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND. The reported sensitivity and yield of image-guided biopsies for diskitis-osteomyelitis vary widely. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of pooled sensitivity data to elucidate strategies for optimal image-guided biopsies among patients suspected to have diskitis-osteomyelitis. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION. A comprehensive literature search was performed for studies of patient populations with proven or suspected diskitis-osteomyelitis that included percutaneous image-guided biopsy as part of the workup algorithm. Type of pathogens, imaging modality used for biopsy guidance, tissue targeted, antibiotic administration at the time of biopsy, true microbiology positives, true microbiology negatives, false microbiology positives, false microbiology negatives, disease (i.e., diskitis-osteomyelitis) positives as determined by reference standard, true infection positives (i.e., positive microbiology or pathology results), and total number of biopsies performed were extracted from the studies. Microbiology sensitivity, microbiology biopsy yield, and infection sensitivity were calculated from the pooled data. These terms and the data required to calculate them were also defined in detail. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS. Thirty-six articles satisfied inclusion criteria and were used for analysis. The pooled microbiology sensitivity, infection sensitivity, and microbiology biopsy yields were 46.6\%, 70.0\%, and 26.7\%, respectively. Mycobacterium tuberculosis-only microbiology sensitivity was significantly higher than both pyogenic bacteria and mixed-organism microbiology sensitivity (p {$<$} .001). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common causative organism (28.6\%). Pooled microbiology sensitivity was not significantly different for CT guidance and fluoroscopy guidance (p = .16). There was a statistically significant difference between pooled microbiology sensitivity of bone/end plate (45.5\%) and disk/paravertebral soft-tissue (64.8\%) image-guided biopsies (p {$<$} .001). There was no statistically significant difference in pooled microbiology sensitivities for patients who received antibiotics before the procedure (46.2\%) and those who did not (44.6\%) (p = .70). CONCLUSION. Image guidance by CT or fluoroscopy does not affect microbiology yield, disk and paravertebral soft-tissue biopsies should be considered over bone and end plate biopsies, and preprocedural antibiotic administration does not appear to impact biopsy results. CLINICAL IMPACT. Understanding and correctly applying reported statistics contribute to appropriate interpretation of the abundant literature on this topic and optimization of care for patients with diskitis-osteomyelitis.},

The aim of this study is to retrospectively analyze the clinical, laboratory, imaging findings of patients with SD treated at our hospital between January 2017 and December 2018. We also evaluated the SD evolution during a short follow-up at 4 and 6 weeks. Methods: The epidemiological, clinical, microbiological, laboratory findings (White Blood Count (WBC), C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Erythrocyte Sedimentation rate (ESR)), Imaging (CT/MRI) and treatment data of 38 patients with SD were studied retrospectively. The laboratory findings (CRP, ESR) and the CT/MRI examinations during the follow-ups at 4 and 6 weeks were evaluated. Based on imaging (CT/MRI) we divided SD into the following 5 types based on morphological features observed: spondylitis or discitis (ST/DS), SD, SD with paravertebral abscesses (SD-PA), SD with epidural abscess (SD-EP) and SD with paravertebral and epidural abscesses (SD-PEA). Results: The most common complaint was pain (95\%) and the main comorbidity was septicemia (42\%). Staphylococcus aureus was found in 45\% of the cases. The WBC was elevated in 32\% of the patients. Both the CRP and ESR decreased during the follow-up. SD was found in 31\% of the cases, SD-PA in 26\% of the cases, ST/DS in 19\% of the cases, SD-PEA in 13\% of the cases and SD-EP in 11\% of the cases. At the follow-up at week 4, SD-PA, SD-EP and SD-PEA had decreased and were found respectively in 21\%, 5\% and 5\% of the cases. In the follow-up at week 6, SD-PA, SD-EP and SD-PEA were found respectively in 10\%, 8\% and 3\% of the patients. Conservative treatment with antibiotic therapy was applied in 63\% of the cases. Surgical treatment was given to 21\% of the patients and an interventional procedure was done on 16\% of the patients. Conclusion: SD diagnosis and management continues to be based on a multidisciplinary approach. Re-imaging in the critical period of 4-6 weeks with the monitoring of systemic inflammatory markers can be a good follow-up strategy.},

  abstract = {CONCEPT: Spondylodiscitis refers to an infection affecting the intervertebral disk, the vertebral body or the posterior arch of the vertebra being aetiologically, pyogenic, granulomatous (tuberculosis, brucellosis, or fungal infection) or parasitic. DIAGNOSIS: Spondylodiscitis diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms, a combination of erythrocyte sedimentation rate with C-reactive protein (CRP) tests and, less useful, leukocytosis. Blood culture is also a very cost-effective method of identifying organisms. Plain radiographs are useful, however changes may take several months to appear. Radionuclide tests are currently less used; nevertheless, fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) shows encouraging results particularly when magnetic resonance images (MRI) are unconvincing in the distinction between degenerative changes and infection. MRI with gadolinium enhancement is the choice for image diagnosis. MANAGEMENT: Medical management is usually the basis for treatment, alone or in combination with surgery. Surgical approach, either by endoscopy or open, is indicated for biopsy when clinical evolution is unsatisfactory and no micro-organism has been isolated, and also whenever a root, spinal cord or dural compression is seen on MRI; spinal instability or severe deformity are also clear indications for surgical treatment. Less invasive surgery either CT-scan guided or, particularly, by endoscopy has good results. However open surgery is still the standard. The anterior approach allows for anterior disc and bone debridement. The posterior approach is indicated when posterior elements are involved or in the presence of an epidural abscess. Although good results have been claimed, the use of instrumentation in the presence of an infected focus is controversial, as the use of cages or BMPs are.},

Although in vitro labeled leukocyte imaging is the radionuclide test of choice for complicating osteomyelitis such as diabetic pedal osteomyelitis and prosthetic joint infection, it is not useful for spondylodiskitis. Antigranulocyte antibodies and antibody fragments have limitations and are not widely available. 111In-biotin is useful for spondylodiskitis. Radiolabeled synthetic fragments of the antimicrobial peptide ubiquicidin are promising infection-specific agents. 18F-FDG is the radiopharmaceutical of choice for spondylodiskitis. Its role in diabetic pedal osteomyelitis and prosthetic joint infection is not established. Preliminary data suggest 68Ga may be useful in musculoskeletal infection. 124I-fialuridine initially showed promise as an infection-specific radiopharmaceutical, but subsequent investigations were disappointing. The development of PET/CT and SPECT/CT imaging systems, which combine anatomic and functional imaging, has revolutionized diagnostic imaging. These hybrid systems are redefining the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected or known infection and inflammation by improving diagnostic accuracy and influencing patient management.},

AIM: To perform an overview on the role of nuclear medicine procedures with single photon emission tomography (SPET) and positron emission tomography (PET) tracers in the diagnosis of spondylodiscitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature review about bone scintigraphy, Gallium-67-citrate scintigraphy, labeled leukocytes scintigraphy and PET was performed. Main findings of the literature were reported. RESULTS: Bone scintigraphy is a sensitive and widely available nuclear medicine technique, but it is characterized by low specificity. Gallium-67-citrate scintigraphy is often used as a complement to bone scintigraphy to enhance the specificity of the study and to detect extra-osseous sites of infection. Labeled leukocytes scintigraphy is not a useful method in the diagnosis of spondylodiscitis. Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is a sensitive method and could potentially be useful in the diagnosis of spondylodiscitis and in the evaluation of treatment response. Nevertheless, scientific literature about this topic is still limited. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, nuclear medicine procedures play a useful role in the diagnosis of spondylodiscitis identifying functional abnormalities which precede morphological changes. Therefore, nuclear medicine procedures may complement or integrate morphological imaging findings in patients with suspected spondylodiscitis.},
